# Community Code of Conduct

Lima follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Reporting

While Lima [aspires](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/issues/947) to become a CNCF Sandbox project, it is not yet part of the CNCF, so for the time being please report violations of the code of conduct to the project [maintainers](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md) via email.
